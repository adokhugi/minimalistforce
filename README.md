Minimalist Force
================

How to run:
The game requires .NET and MonoGame, which is included in the package.

Game Objective:
Immunity Force is a turn-based tactical role-playing game. You control a party of several characters which can grow by means of recruiting neutral characters using the "RECRUIT" spell. Your task is to win the battle by defeating all the opponents. The characters have their turns depending on their agility. When it is time to determine the action of a character, you can control the movement using the cursor keys. Press D to stop at the current position. Then a menu will open in which you can choose the action to perform: attack, use magic, use an item or simply stay. Again, control is performed using the cursor keys and D. If you choose attack, you will have to select an opponent to attack. Which opponent you may select is determined by the position and attack range of your character. Regarding magic, the characters who know magic have one or several spells. Some spells can be used to cure your own characters, others to damage opponents. Items mostly have the purpose to cure characters. If you select "stay", the character will not do anything in this round. The fights between individual party members and opponents are non-interactive, you only get a summary of the damage inflicted upon each side. If you have lost the battle, the game is over and you have to restart from the beginning.

Graphics:
The graphics are deliberately simple. The party members have one dot in the center, the enemies have two dots. Neutral characters have no dots until they are recruited, by which they become either a member of the party or of the enemies.

Randomness:
The battlefield is randomly generated every time you start the game. So no instance of the game is exactly the same as another one.

Controls:
Cursor keys, the Enter key and the keys A, S, D will suffice throughout the game.

Credits:
The game was programmed by Claus D. Volko using Visual Studio 2022 and MonoGame 3.5.
